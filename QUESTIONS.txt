*How can we find out the group name of the server we connect to or that are connecting to us ?

*Are we dinamicly connecting to servers and constantly changing between them and only sending msg by 1 hop. 
or are we expected to send a msg along a route ? if so do we need to have some sort of routing table ?

*Listservers, and servers in Server commands are they interrelated ? as in other servers can send the command 
LISTSERVERS,<FROM_GROUP_ID> and our server responds with sending a msg back with the command SERVERS? Or can 
all servers send both commands seperately?

*STATUSREQ,FROM GROUP and STATUSRESP,FROM GROUP,TO GROUP,<server, msgs held> also interrelated ? 


*KEEPALIVE, do we send keepalive on zero msg awaiting ?
